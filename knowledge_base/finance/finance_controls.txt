Financial Controls and Procedures

Segregation of Duties
No single person controls all aspects of a financial transaction. Separate: Authorization, recording, custody, reconciliation.

Reduces fraud risk and errors. Small teams may require compensating controls like management review.

Authorization Controls
Transactions require appropriate authorization based on amount and type. Authorization matrix defines approval authorities.

Approvers verify business purpose, budget availability, and policy compliance. Document approvals in system.

Reconciliation Procedures
Bank reconciliations performed monthly within 10 days of month-end. Investigate and resolve discrepancies promptly.

Account reconciliations for all balance sheet accounts. Reconciler and reviewer must be different people.

Payment Controls
Payments require approved invoice, PO, and receiving confirmation (3-way match). Verify vendor banking details before first payment.

Dual approval for payments over $25000. Positive pay system prevents check fraud. ACH payments require dual authorization.

Revenue Recognition
