New Employee Onboarding Guide

Before Your First Day
You'll receive a welcome email with your start date, time, location (or video link), and what to bring. Complete any pre-employment paperwork sent by HR.

Your laptop and equipment will be shipped to arrive before your start date. Don't open the box - we'll set it up together on day one.

First Day Agenda
Your first day starts at 10 AM with HR orientation covering benefits, policies, and systems. You'll complete required paperwork and receive your employee ID.

Meet your manager and team, get your workspace set up, and have lunch with your onboarding buddy. End the day with a welcome meeting with your department head.

First Week Goals
Complete all required training modules including security awareness, code of conduct, and system tutorials. Set up your development environment and tools.

Schedule 1-on-1 meetings with key team members and stakeholders. Review your 30-60-90 day plan with your manager.

30-60-90 Day Plan
First 30 days: Learn systems, processes, and team dynamics. Complete onboarding tasks and shadow team members. Start contributing to small projects.

Days 31-60: Take ownership of specific tasks and projects. Begin participating in team meetings and decision-making. Seek feedback regularly.

Days 61-90: Operate independently on assigned work. Contribute ideas and improvements. Complete first performance check-in with manager.

Onboarding Buddy Program
Your buddy is a peer who will help you navigate the company, answer questions, and provide informal support during your first 90 days.

Schedule regular check-ins with your buddy. They're your go-to for questions about culture, unwritten rules, and day-to-day operations.

Resources and Support
Access the employee portal for policies, forms, and resources. Join relevant Slack channels for your team and interests.

HR is available for questions about benefits, policies, or concerns. Your manager is your primary point of contact for work-related questions.
