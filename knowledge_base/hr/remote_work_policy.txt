Remote Work Policy

Eligibility and Approval
Remote work is available to employees whose roles can be performed effectively outside the office. Approval is at manager's discretion based on role requirements and performance.

New employees typically work on-site or hybrid for the first 90 days to facilitate onboarding and team integration.

Work Environment Requirements
Remote employees must have a dedicated workspace with reliable high-speed internet (minimum 25 Mbps download, 5 Mbps upload).

Workspace should be quiet, professional, and free from distractions during work hours. Ensure proper ergonomics to prevent injury.

Equipment and Technology
The company provides laptop, monitor, keyboard, mouse, and necessary software. Additional equipment may be approved based on role requirements.

Home office stipend of $500 provided for desk, chair, and other setup needs. Monthly internet reimbursement of $75.

Communication and Availability
Remote employees must be available during core hours (10 AM - 4 PM local time) for meetings and collaboration. Keep your Slack status updated.

Respond to messages and emails within expected timeframes. Use video for team meetings to maintain connection and engagement.

Security Requirements
Follow all IT security policies including VPN usage, password management, and data protection. Never share login credentials or leave devices unattended.

Ensure your home network is secured with WPA2 or WPA3 encryption. Install company-approved security software and keep systems updated.

Performance Expectations
Remote work is a privilege contingent on maintaining performance standards. Managers will evaluate productivity, communication, and collaboration.

If performance issues arise, remote work privileges may be modified or revoked. Regular check-ins ensure alignment and address concerns early.

Hybrid Work Arrangements
Hybrid employees split time between office and remote work. Coordinate with your team to ensure adequate coverage and collaboration opportunities.

Office days should be used for meetings, team activities, and work requiring in-person collaboration. Remote days for focused individual work.

Travel and Relocation
If you plan to work remotely from a different location temporarily (more than 2 weeks), notify your manager and HR for approval.

Permanent relocation may affect compensation based on location. Discuss with HR before making relocation decisions.
