Performance Management System

Performance Review Cycle
We conduct formal performance reviews twice annually in June and December. Reviews assess goal achievement, competencies, and overall contribution.

Your manager will schedule a review meeting to discuss feedback, accomplishments, and development areas. Reviews inform compensation decisions and promotion eligibility.

Goal Setting Process
At the start of each review period, you'll work with your manager to set SMART goals aligned with team and company objectives.

Goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. Typically 3-5 major goals per period with clear success criteria.

Continuous Feedback
We encourage ongoing feedback rather than waiting for formal reviews. Managers should provide regular check-ins at least monthly.

Peers can provide feedback anytime through the 360-feedback tool. Constructive feedback should be specific, timely, and actionable.

Performance Improvement Plans
If performance falls below expectations, your manager will work with you on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) outlining specific areas for improvement.

PIPs typically run 60-90 days with clear milestones and support resources. Regular check-ins track progress and provide guidance.

Career Development
Discuss career aspirations during performance reviews. We support internal mobility and provide pathways for both individual contributor and management tracks.

Promotion criteria include sustained high performance, demonstrated readiness for next level, and business need. Promotions are reviewed quarterly.
