Employee Grievance and Complaint Policy

Purpose and Scope
This policy provides a fair and transparent process for employees to raise concerns about workplace issues, treatment, or policy violations.

All employees have the right to raise grievances without fear of retaliation. We are committed to resolving issues promptly and fairly.

Informal Resolution
We encourage employees to first attempt informal resolution by discussing concerns directly with the involved party or their immediate manager.

Many issues can be resolved through open communication. Your manager can facilitate discussions or provide guidance on next steps.

Formal Grievance Process
If informal resolution is unsuccessful or inappropriate, submit a written grievance to HR including details of the issue, parties involved, and desired resolution.

HR will acknowledge receipt within 2 business days and begin investigation. You may be asked to provide additional information or documentation.

Investigation Procedure
HR will conduct a thorough and impartial investigation, interviewing relevant parties and reviewing documentation. Investigations typically complete within 15 business days.

All parties are expected to cooperate fully and maintain confidentiality. Findings and recommended actions will be documented.

Resolution and Appeal
You'll receive written notification of the investigation outcome and any actions taken. If you're unsatisfied with the resolution, you may appeal to the department head within 10 days.

Appeals are reviewed by senior leadership and HR. The appeal decision is final.

Protection from Retaliation
Retaliation against anyone who raises a grievance in good faith is strictly prohibited and will result in disciplinary action up to termination.

If you experience retaliation, report it immediately to HR or use the anonymous ethics hotline.

Confidentiality
Grievances are handled confidentially to the extent possible. Information is shared only with those who need to know for investigation and resolution purposes.

All parties involved are expected to maintain confidentiality throughout the process.
