Hiring and Recruitment Process

Requisition Approval
Hiring managers submit job requisitions through the HR portal including role description, level, budget, and business justification.

Requisitions are reviewed by department heads and HR for approval. Once approved, the role is posted internally for 5 days before external posting.

Interview Process
Our standard process includes: phone screen (30 min), technical/skills assessment (60-90 min), team interviews (2-3 rounds), and final interview with hiring manager.

All interviewers complete bias training and use structured interview guides. We aim to complete the process within 3 weeks of application.

Candidate Evaluation
Interviewers submit feedback within 24 hours using our standardized rubric. Hiring decisions are made collectively considering all feedback.

We evaluate technical skills, cultural fit, communication, problem-solving, and growth potential. References are checked before extending offers.

Offer Process
HR prepares offer letters including compensation, benefits, start date, and any conditions. Offers require approval from hiring manager and department head.

Candidates typically have 5-7 business days to accept. We're happy to answer questions and negotiate within approved parameters.

Onboarding Preparation
Once offer is accepted, HR initiates background check and prepares onboarding materials. IT provisions equipment and accounts.

New hire's manager prepares 30-60-90 day plan and assigns an onboarding buddy. First day agenda includes orientation, system setup, and team introductions.

Internal Mobility
Current employees are encouraged to apply for internal openings. Internal candidates are given priority consideration if qualifications match.

Managers should support employee growth and not block internal transfers. Transition timeline is negotiated between current and future managers.
