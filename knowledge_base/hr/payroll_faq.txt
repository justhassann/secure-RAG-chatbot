Payroll Frequently Asked Questions

When Do I Get Paid?
Payroll is processed bi-weekly on Fridays. If payday falls on a holiday, payment is processed the business day before.

Direct deposit typically arrives by 9 AM on payday. Paper checks are available upon request but may take additional processing time.

How Do I Update Direct Deposit?
Log into the HR portal and navigate to Payroll > Direct Deposit. You can add, edit, or remove bank accounts.

Changes must be submitted at least 5 business days before the next pay period to take effect. You'll receive confirmation once processed.

Understanding Your Payslip
Your payslip shows gross pay, deductions (taxes, benefits, retirement), and net pay. Year-to-date totals are included for tax purposes.

Pre-tax deductions include health insurance and 401(k) contributions. Post-tax deductions include any garnishments or voluntary contributions.

Tax Withholding
Update your W-4 tax withholding anytime through the HR portal. Changes take effect in the next pay period.

Consult a tax professional if you're unsure about appropriate withholding. The company cannot provide tax advice.

Overtime and Time Tracking
Non-exempt employees must track hours worked and submit timesheets by end of day Friday for that week's pay period.

Overtime (over 40 hours/week) is paid at 1.5x regular rate. All overtime must be pre-approved by your manager.

Payroll Errors
If you notice an error in your paycheck, contact HR immediately. We'll investigate and issue corrections within 2 business days.

For underpayments, we'll process an off-cycle payment. Overpayments will be deducted from future paychecks unless other arrangements are made.

Year-End Tax Documents
W-2 forms are available by January 31st each year through the HR portal. You'll receive an email notification when available.
