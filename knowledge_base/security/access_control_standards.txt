Access Control Standards

Access Control Principles
Least privilege: Users have minimum access needed for their role. Need-to-know: Access granted only for legitimate business need.

Separation of duties: No single user has excessive privileges. Regular access reviews ensure appropriate access.

User Account Management
Unique user accounts for each person. No shared accounts except approved service accounts.

Account creation requires manager approval. Access provisioned based on role and department. Accounts disabled immediately upon termination.

Authentication Requirements
Strong passwords required (12+ characters, complexity). Multi-factor authentication (MFA) mandatory for all systems.

Biometric authentication encouraged where available. Single sign-on (SSO) for integrated systems.

Authorization Levels
Read-only: View data but cannot modify. User: Standard access for role. Power user: Additional capabilities for advanced users.

Administrator: Full system control. Granted sparingly with approval. Privileged access monitored closely.

Role-Based Access Control
Access assigned based on job role. Standard roles defined for common positions.

Custom roles for unique requirements. Role changes trigger access review and adjustment.

Access Request Process
Submit access requests through IT portal. Include: System, access level, business justification.

Manager approval required. Additional approval for privileged access. Access provisioned within 1 business day.

Access Reviews
Quarterly access reviews by managers. Verify each user's access is still appropriate.

Remove unnecessary access. Document review completion. Audit tracks review compliance.

Privileged Access Management
Privileged accounts (admin, root) require additional controls. Just-in-time access: Elevated privileges granted temporarily when needed.

Privileged sessions recorded. Regular audits of privileged account usage.

Service Accounts
