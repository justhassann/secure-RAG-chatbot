Security Incident Severity Matrix

Severity Levels Overview
Incidents classified by severity to ensure appropriate response. Severity based on: Impact, scope, data sensitivity, business criticality.

P1 (Critical), P2 (High), P3 (Medium), P4 (Low). Severity determines response time and escalation.

P1 - Critical Incidents
Definition: Severe impact to business operations or data. Active data breach or ransomware. Customer-facing systems down. Widespread system compromise.

Response Time: 15 minutes. Escalation: Immediate to incident commander and CISO. Notification: Executive team, legal, PR.

Examples: Active data exfiltration, ransomware encryption, complete system outage, confirmed APT.

P2 - High Incidents
Definition: Significant impact to operations or data. Potential data breach. Important systems impaired. Multiple systems compromised.

Response Time: 1 hour. Escalation: Senior security analyst and manager. Notification: Department heads, IT leadership.

Examples: Malware infection, unauthorized access to sensitive data, DDoS attack, significant vulnerability exploitation.

P3 - Medium Incidents
Definition: Moderate impact. Single system compromised. Minor data exposure. Degraded performance.

Response Time: 4 hours. Escalation: Security analyst. Notification: Affected department, IT team.

Examples: Phishing attempt, policy violation, minor malware, unsuccessful attack attempt, suspicious activity.

P4 - Low Incidents
Definition: Minimal impact. Informational alerts. Potential security concerns. No immediate threat.

Response Time: Next business day. Escalation: None unless pattern emerges. Notification: Security team only.

Examples: Failed login attempts, low-risk vulnerability, security awareness issue, minor policy violation.

Impact Assessment Factors
Confidentiality: Data exposure or theft. Integrity: Data modification or corruption. Availability: System or service disruption.

Scope: Number of systems, users, or customers affected. Duration: Length of impact or exposure.

Data Sensitivity: Classification level of affected data.

Business Impact Criteria
Revenue impact: Lost sales, transaction processing disruption. Reputation: Customer trust, brand damage, media attention.

Regulatory: Compliance violations, reporting requirements. Legal: Potential lawsuits, contractual breaches.

Operational: Productivity loss, recovery costs.

Severity Escalation
Incidents may be escalated to higher severity as investigation reveals greater impact.

Escalation triggers: Broader scope than initially assessed, sensitive data involved, prolonged duration, regulatory implications.

Document escalation rationale.

Severity Downgrade
Incidents may be downgraded if impact less severe than initially assessed.

Downgrade only after thorough investigation confirms lower impact. Document downgrade justification.

Maintain audit trail of severity changes.

Response Time SLAs
P1: Acknowledge 15 min, Initial assessment 30 min, Containment 2 hours.

P2: Acknowledge 1 hour, Initial assessment 2 hours, Containment 8 hours.

P3: Acknowledge 4 hours, Initial assessment 8 hours, Containment 24 hours.

P4: Acknowledge next business day, Assessment 3 days, Resolution 5 days.

Communication Requirements
P1: Hourly updates to stakeholders. Status page updates. Executive briefings.

P2: Updates every 4 hours. Stakeholder notifications. Management briefings.

P3: Daily updates. Affected parties notified. Standard reporting.

P4: Update on resolution. Documented in ticket. Monthly summary reporting.

Severity-Based Resources
P1: Full incident response team, external experts if needed, dedicated resources.

P2: Senior analysts, manager involvement, additional resources as needed.

P3: Assigned analyst, standard resources.

P4: Analyst as available, standard tools.

Post-Incident Review Requirements
P1/P2: Mandatory post-incident review within 48 hours. Root cause analysis. Lessons learned. Action items.

P3: Review if recurring or significant learning opportunity.

P4: Documented in ticket, no formal review unless pattern identified.
