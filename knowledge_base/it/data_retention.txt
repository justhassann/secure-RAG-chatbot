Data Retention and Disposal Policy

Retention Periods
Email: 7 years. Financial records: 7 years. HR records: 7 years post-employment. Contracts: 7 years post-expiration.

Project documents: 3 years post-completion. General business records: 3 years. Marketing materials: 1 year.

Legal Hold
Data subject to legal hold must be preserved regardless of retention period. Legal team will notify of legal holds.

Don't delete or modify data under legal hold. Contact legal team with questions about legal hold scope.

Data Classification and Retention
Retention periods vary by data classification. Restricted data may have longer retention due to regulatory requirements.

Consult data classification guide for specific retention requirements. When in doubt, contact compliance team.

Email Retention
Email is automatically archived after 90 days. Archived email remains searchable and accessible. Auto-deletion occurs after retention period.

Don't use personal email for business communication - it's not captured by retention systems.

File Storage Retention
Files on network drives and cloud storage are retained per policy. Inactive files may be archived to reduce storage costs.

Organize files logically and delete obsolete files. Don't hoard unnecessary data.

Backup Retention
Daily backups retained for 30 days. Weekly backups retained for 90 days. Monthly backups retained for 1 year.

Backups are for disaster recovery, not long-term archival. Use proper document management for long-term retention.

Data Disposal
Data disposal must ensure data cannot be recovered. Use secure deletion tools for electronic data. Shred physical documents.

IT handles disposal of devices and media. Don't throw devices in regular trash.

End of Life Data
When systems are decommissioned, data is migrated or securely deleted. Stakeholders are notified before decommissioning.

Verify data migration completeness before old system deletion. Retain system documentation per retention policy.

Personal Data Retention
Personal data (employee, customer) is retained only as long as needed for business or legal purposes.

Comply with data subject requests for deletion (right to be forgotten) unless legal obligation requires retention.

Retention Compliance
Compliance team audits retention practices annually. Departments must demonstrate compliance with retention policies.

Violations may result in legal or regulatory penalties. Report retention concerns to compliance team.
