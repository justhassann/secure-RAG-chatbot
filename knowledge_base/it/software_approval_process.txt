Software Approval and Licensing

Software Request Process
Submit software requests through IT portal including software name, purpose, cost, and business justification.

IT evaluates requests for security, compatibility, licensing, and business need. Approval typically takes 3-5 business days.

Security Review
All software undergoes security review before approval. Review includes vulnerability assessment, vendor reputation, and data handling practices.

Open source software requires additional review of license terms and community support. Some licenses may not be compatible with commercial use.

Licensing Compliance
Use only properly licensed software. Don't install personal licenses on company devices or use company licenses on personal devices.

Track license usage to ensure compliance. Unused licenses should be reclaimed and reassigned.

Approved Software List
Consult approved software list in IT portal before requesting new software. Approved software has completed security review and has active licenses.

Standard software is pre-installed on company devices. Request installation of approved software through IT portal.

Prohibited Software
Don't install: Pirated software, peer-to-peer file sharing, remote access tools (except approved), cryptocurrency miners, or software from untrusted sources.

Prohibited software will be removed if detected. Violations may result in disciplinary action.

Software Updates
Keep all software updated to latest stable version. Enable automatic updates where possible. Critical security updates are mandatory.

IT may push updates remotely for security patches. Don't disable or postpone critical updates.

Cloud Software and SaaS
Cloud software requests follow same approval process. Additional considerations: data residency, vendor security practices, integration requirements.

Use SSO for cloud software when available. Ensure proper offboarding procedures for cloud access.

Open Source Software
Open source software requires review of license terms (GPL, MIT, Apache, etc.). Some licenses have restrictions on commercial use or require source code disclosure.

Evaluate community support and update frequency. Abandoned projects pose security risks.

Software License Management
IT maintains software license inventory. License audits conducted annually. Ensure you're using assigned licenses correctly.

Report unused software for license reclamation. Don't share licenses or install on multiple devices unless license permits.

Vendor Management
Software vendors must complete security questionnaire and sign data protection agreements. Vendor risk is assessed based on data access and criticality.

Maintain vendor contact information for support and security notifications.

Trial Software
Trial software requires same approval as purchased software. Trials must have defined evaluation period and decision criteria.

Remove trial software after evaluation period if not purchasing. Don't use trial software for production work.
